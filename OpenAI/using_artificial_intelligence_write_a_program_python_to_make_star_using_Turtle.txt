OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write a program python to make star using Turtle
*****************

Certainly! Below is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw a star using artificial intelligence-like logic. While Turtle graphics itself is straightforward, I'll add a bit of "intelligence" by defining a function that calculates the star points dynamically based on the number of points and size, which could be considered a simple form of procedural generation.

```python
import turtle
import math

def draw_star(t, points, radius):
    """
    Draw a star with the given number of points and radius.
    
    Parameters:
    t (turtle.Turtle): The turtle object to draw with.
    points (int): Number of points in the star.
    radius (int): Radius of the circumcircle of the star.
    """
    if points < 5:
        print("Number of points must be at least 5.")
        return
    
    # Calculate the angle between star points
    angle = 180 - (180 / points)
    
    # Move turtle to starting position
    t.penup()
    t.goto(0, -radius)
    t.pendown()
    
    # Set initial heading
    t.setheading(90 + (180 / points))
    
    for _ in range(points):
        t.forward(radius)
